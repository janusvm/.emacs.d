# My Emacs configuration

This repository contains my personal settings for Emacs.
I've gotten a lot of inspiration for this setup from [magnars/.emacs.d](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d), so be sure to check that out too.


## Notes

Since this is a personal config, I make very little efforts to make it portable.
If you want to clone this for immediate use as-is, be aware of the following:

- The config is made for my Ubuntu machine, and I don't know if it works on Windows
- The default font is set to _Iosevka SS04 Regular_ (see [be5invis/iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)) in `settings/set-appearance.el`
- Packages are automatically installed on first run from (in order of priority) Melpa Stable, GNU Elpa, Melpa
